1. docker version  --> from windows I'm calling the software docker which is installed in ubuntu OS
   docker client
   docker server
   
2. docker run hello-world
   you have asked hey docker client give me hello world message
   docker client asks docker server
   docker server searches whether image to display hello-world is present in local cache or not
   if it is not there then it pulls the image from github
   it creates container from image. 
   Image contains startup command and file system snapshot
   when docker run is written, default startup command is executed
   
 3. docker run busybox echo hello sushma
    in place of startup command run the command echo hello sushma
    will run hello sushma and will exit
        
 4. docker run busybox ls
    lists all files and folders inside busybox
    
 5.
