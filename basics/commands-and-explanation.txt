1. docker version  --> from windows I'm calling the software docker which is installed in ubuntu OS
   docker client
   docker server
   
2. docker run hello-world
   you have asked hey docker client give me hello world message
   docker client asks docker server
   docker server searches whether image to display hello-world is present in local cache or not
   if it is not there then it pulls the image from github
   it creates container from image.
