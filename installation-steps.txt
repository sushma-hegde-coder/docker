1. I want to configure a virtual machine on my physical machine. So download virtualbox --> a software to configure VM on top of my machine
   Here I want linux(ubuntu) on top of windows
   Docker operates inside Virtual machine(here we have windows and docker works under linux)
2. Docker quickstart terminal - Spins(boot up) VM and sets up(configure) docker in windows 10
3. docker version
   2 components of docker - docker client and docker server
   docker client reachs out to docker server
   docker client - from where are you using docker - OS is windoes
   docker server- docker operates inside VM linux (docker is a software that runs in Linux OS)
